### THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

## Info
This is an anti-cheat written for GFL, licensed to them by Lily (STEAM_0:1:8115)

## How to use?

It is currently non-obfuscated, with only boilerplate code and a few iterations of organizational ideas and simply implementations.

**In other words, it is not ready to use and should not be deployed in any shape, way, or form.**

## Who is this targeting?

This is targeting *general* cheat features and other simple cheats. 
Due to the fact the lua state is always controlled by the user in the end, you cannot win against determined cheaters.

***But*** it is possible to limit their effectiveness and make probable guesses whether someone is cheating or not based on data received and compared.

In otherwords, it's a general use anti-cheat that should be effective against most, if not all, public cheats, and hamper private cheats significantly.
