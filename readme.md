### THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

## Info
This is an anti-cheat written for myself, licensed to no-one by Lily (STEAM_0:1:8115)

## How to use?

It is currently non-obfuscated, with simple server-side verification and detection. No client-side info is checked aside from CVar data/ Screengrabber / simple data transfer.

**The AC currently targets specific features and relies on keeping the player in the dark of methods used.**

Simple drag-and-drop should work, provided you have the module it requires.

## Who is this targeting?

This is targeting *general* cheat features and other simple cheats. 
Due to the fact the lua state is always controlled by the user in the end, you cannot win against determined, smart cheaters.

***But*** it is possible to limit their effectiveness and make probable guesses whether someone is cheating or not based on data received and compared.

In otherwords, it's a general use anti-cheat that should be effective against most, if not all, public cheats, and hamper private cheats significantly.
